    <p style="color: red;""><b>What is Shoegaze?</b></p>
    <p style="color: ;background-color:#FF3381;"">The term shoegaze was made because frequently, at live shows, bands who would display this type of style would often stare at their feet because of the various pedals and effects used in the genre. You can often find soft to ethereal vocals, guitars with heavy distortion and post processing effects that used elements of noise such as feedback, overdriven bass, and sample styled drums. Its origins are mostly in the UK/Ireland coming off of other various styles such as Neo-psychedelic, Dream Pop, Post Punk, Alternative Rock, and Indie.

    <p style="color: red;""><b>Influence of MBV and Loveless</b></p>
    <p style="color: ;background-color:#FF3381;""> Loveless is seen as the pinnacle and blueprint of this genre. It was released in 1991 and recorded in the UK. Infamously this album was known to bankrupt the label it was on because of Kevin Shields heavy experimentation with studio equipment and guitar effects. It was said to cost around £500,000 in total. This album brought in a technique known as “gliding” guitar, this used elements of vibrato, unconventional tunnings, sampling, very droney dreamy effects. This can still be seen in many bands today, ones that don’t even associate with the genre. Shoegaze was very pure in the 90’s and 2000’s but has now moved on to being an element in most modern popular genres.
